# knightd3-intermediate

These code examples to accompany the online course “Intermediate D3” taught by [Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/) and offered by the [Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas](http://journalismcourses.org) at UT Austin, from October 26 to November 22, 2015.

Examples are grouped by module, with each folder corresponding to a different module of the course.

If you are not sure whether this course is for you, please explore [the code examples](https://github.com/alignedleft/data-vis-d3) from the preceding course, “[Data Visualization and Infographics with D3](http://journalismcourses.org/D30815.html).” You should be famliar with all of the concepts from that introductory course before attempting this one.

Some of these examples are adapted from the sample code files for *[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026938.do)* (O’Reilly, March 2013).
